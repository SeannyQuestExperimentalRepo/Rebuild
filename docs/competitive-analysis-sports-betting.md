# Competitive Landscape: Sports Betting Analytics & Picks Platforms
### Compiled February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

The sports betting analytics market has exploded since the 2018 PASPA repeal, with 38+ states now offering legal sports betting. The competitive landscape ranges from free content-driven affiliate sites (Pickswise, Covers) to sophisticated quantitative platforms (Unabated, EVAnalytics). Most platforms monetize through either subscriptions ($10-$300/mo) or sportsbook affiliate revenue. A significant gap exists for platforms offering **transparent, ensemble-model analytics** at accessible price points with modern mobile UX.

## 3. Key Differentiators Analysis

### Who Uses KenPom-Level Advanced Metrics?
- **Unabated** — Massey-Peabody Ratings (closest analog to KenPom for betting)
- **EVAnalytics** — Claims sabermetric-level modeling
- **Dimers** — Machine learning models incorporating advanced stats
- **Nobody** prominently integrates KenPom directly into a betting product for CBB (gap!)

### Who Has Elo Ratings?
- **FiveThirtyEight (now defunct as standalone)** — pioneered Elo for sports predictions
- **Dimers** — likely uses Elo-like components in their ML models
- **No major betting platform** prominently features Elo ratings as a product (gap!)

### Who Uses EPA for NFL?
- **EVAnalytics** — likely incorporates advanced NFL metrics
- **Unabated** — Massey-Peabody uses efficiency metrics
- **No platform** prominently markets EPA-based NFL models (major gap!)

### Who Has Ensemble Models?
- **Unabated** — blends multiple market-maker lines into The Unabated Line
- **Dimers** — ML models likely ensemble multiple signals
- **BettingPros** — consensus aggregation across experts (human ensemble)
- **Most platforms** use single proprietary models — ensemble approach is underserved

### Who Shows Methodology Transparently?
- **Unabated** — BEST. Publishes detailed explanations of every tool
- **BettingPros** — Expert accuracy leaderboards are transparent
- **EVAnalytics** — Describes approach conceptually
- **Most others** hide behind "proprietary algorithm" language

### Who Has the Best Mobile Experience?
1. **Action Network** — Best dedicated betting media app
2. **FanDuel/DraftKings** — Best overall mobile UX (but they're sportsbooks)
3. **BetQL** — Good mobile app
4. **Dimers** — Responsive web, no native app prominence
5. **Unabated** — Web-focused, no native app (weakness)

### Who Has the Best Track Record?
- Hard to verify across the board. Most platforms cherry-pick.
- **BettingPros** — Most transparent with expert accuracy leaderboards
- **Unabated** — Focused on providing tools, not picks (avoids the question elegantly)
- **Action Network** — PRO Systems have published backtests
- **Doc's/Cappers** — Claims are often exaggerated or unverifiable

## 4. Gaps in the Market

### What Bettors Complain About (Reddit/Twitter/Forums)

1. **"Every platform is just an affiliate site now"** — Picks exist to drive sportsbook signups, not to help bettors win. Trust erosion is massive.

2. **"No one shows their actual methodology"** — "Proprietary model" is a red flag. Bettors want to understand WHY a pick is being made, not just follow blindly.

3. **"Track records are fake or cherry-picked"** — No industry-standard verification. Cappers show winning streaks, hide losing months.

4. **"I can't combine multiple rating systems myself"** — Bettors who follow KenPom, Sagarin, Elo, EPA, etc. have no tool to blend them into a single view with customizable weights.

5. **"Props tools are either too basic or too expensive"** — The middle market ($15-30/mo) for prop analytics is underserved.

6. **"Notifications are garbage"** — Most apps either spam or don't alert for the right things (line movements, value windows opening).

7. **"No one does CBB well"** — College basketball is underserved. KenPom is the gold standard for ratings but doesn't do picks. No platform bridges advanced CBB analytics to actionable betting signals.

8. **"Mobile experience for analytics is terrible"** — Unabated and most sharp tools are desktop-first. Bettors want to check edge on their phone at the bar.

9. **"I want to see the math, not just the pick"** — Win probability, EV calculation, edge size, confidence interval — show the work.

10. **"Free tiers are useless"** — Most free tiers are so stripped down they serve only as ads for paid.

### Features People Wish Existed

1. **Transparent ensemble models** — "Let me see KenPom + Elo + EPA + market-based rating blended together, with adjustable weights"
2. **Historical model accuracy by sport/bet type** — "Show me your model's ROI on CBB totals for the last 3 seasons"
3. **Personal bankroll analytics** — Beyond tracking wins/losses: CLV (closing line value), edge accuracy, sport-by-sport ROI
4. **Real-time edge alerts** — "Notify me when your model finds >3% EV on a CBB spread"
5. **Methodology education** — "Teach me what EPA means and why it matters for this pick"
6. **Community with accountability** — Verified records, ranked contributors, no fake gurus

### Where Current Platforms Fall Short

| Gap | Who Falls Short | Opportunity |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| Transparent methodology | Almost everyone | Show the math, cite the sources |
| Ensemble model approach | Everyone except Unabated (market-side only) | Combine KenPom + Elo + EPA + proprietary |
| College basketball depth | Everyone | KenPom-level analytics + betting signals |
| Mobile-first sharp tools | Unabated, EVAnalytics | PWA or native app with edge alerts |
| Trust/verification | Cappers, Doc's, most picks sites | Blockchain-verified or third-party audited records |
| Education + analytics | Everyone (separate silos) | Explain the why, not just the what |
| Price accessibility | Unabated ($100+/mo) | Sharp tools at $15-30/mo range |
| NFL EPA integration | Everyone | EPA-driven models with betting outputs |

## 6. Strategic Implications

### The Whitespace Opportunity
There is a clear gap for a platform that:

1. **Uses transparent ensemble models** (KenPom + Elo + EPA + market-based) — nobody does this well
2. **Shows the math** — confidence intervals, EV calculations, model breakdowns
3. **Prices at $15-25/mo** — between free content sites and Unabated's premium
4. **Mobile-first** — PWA with smart notifications for edge alerts
5. **Focuses on CBB + NFL** initially — CBB is massively underserved, NFL is highest demand
6. **Publishes verified track records** — third-party auditable, historical accuracy by bet type
7. **Educates while it recommends** — "Here's the pick AND here's why, explained with the underlying metrics"

### Defensible Moats to Build
- Proprietary ensemble model calibration (unique signal blending)
- Historical track record (compounds over time)
- Community trust through transparency
- Data pipeline breadth (KenPom + EPA + proprietary ratings)
- Mobile UX excellence

### Revenue Model Comparison
| Model | Examples | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| Subscription only | Unabated, EVAnalytics | Aligned incentives | Slower growth |
| Affiliate + freemium | Action Network, Covers | High revenue | Trust erosion |
| Picks marketplace | Doc's Sports | Revenue per expert | Quality control |
| Free + ads | Pickswise, OddsShark | Scale | No moat |
| **Recommended: Subscription + limited affiliate** | — | Balanced | Requires clear wall between editorial and affiliate |
