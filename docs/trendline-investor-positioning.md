# Trendline: Investor Positioning Strategy

## The Bloomberg Terminal for Sports Bettors

**Prepared: February 2026**

---

## I. ELEVATOR PITCH

Trendline is an AI-powered sports betting analytics platform that gives serious bettors the same quantitative edge that Bloomberg gives traders. Unlike tout services that sell picks based on personality and hype, Trendline builds ensemble models from proprietary data pipelines — KenPom/Barttorvik fusion for college basketball, EPA models for NFL, Four Factors for NBA, and Elo ratings calibrated across 150,000+ games in four sports — all with point-in-time backtesting that eliminates lookahead bias. In a $30B+ US market growing 15%+ annually with 38+ legal states and counting, Trendline is positioned to be the analytics infrastructure layer that every serious bettor and media company needs.

## II. MARKET LANDSCAPE

### A. Market Size & Growth

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| US sports betting handle (2024) | ~$120B+ wagered |
| US sports betting revenue (2024) | ~$14-16B (gross gaming revenue) |
| Projected US market (2030) | $35-45B GGR |
| CAGR | ~15-18% |
| States with legal sports betting | 38+ (as of early 2026) |
| States pending/likely by 2028 | 42-45 |
| Mobile betting % of handle | ~85-90% |

### B. Key Market Drivers

- **Regulatory tailwind**: Post-*Murphy v. NCAA* (2018), state-by-state legalization has been steady. Major holdouts (Texas, California, Georgia) represent massive untapped markets — California alone could be $3-5B in annual GGR.
- **Mobile-first behavior**: 85-90% of legal wagers placed via mobile apps, creating a natural distribution channel for analytics tools.
- **Normalization of sports betting**: Integration into ESPN, major broadcast networks, and league partnerships has destigmatized betting. Sports betting is now a media category, not just gambling.
- **Growing sophistication**: As recreational bettors lose money, demand for data-driven tools grows. The "sharp" bettor population is expanding.

## III. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE & COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS

### A. Recent Deals & Funding (2020-2026)

| **BetQL** | Acquired by Audacy/Sports Illustrated | Undisclosed (est. $20-40M) | 2021 | Pick engine with model-driven approach |
| **The Lines** | Acquired by Better Collective | Undisclosed | 2022 | Odds comparison tool |
| **Oddsjam** | Bootstrapped/profitable | N/A | 2022+ | Positive EV / arbitrage tool, strong retention |
| **Unabated** | Bootstrapped/growing | N/A | 2023+ | Sharp bettor tools, screen/line analysis |

| **PropSwap** | Acquired | Undisclosed | 2022 | Secondary market for futures tickets |

### B. Valuation Benchmarks

- **Content/analytics platforms**: 8-15x revenue (Action Network ~12x at acquisition)
- **B2B data providers**: 10-20x revenue (Sportradar, Genius Sports)
- **Consumer subscription (pre-revenue/early)**: $5-20M seed valuations based on tech, team, TAM
- **Key insight**: Companies with **proprietary data or models** command significantly higher multiples than pure content plays

### C. Trendline's Competitive Position

| Competitor | Model Transparency | Multi-Sport Models | Backtesting | Data Moat |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Action Network | ❌ Content-driven | ❌ Picks, not models | ❌ | Low |
| BetQL | Partial | ✅ | ❌ | Medium |
| OddsJam | N/A (arb tool) | ✅ | ❌ | Low (odds scraping) |
| Unabated | Partial | ✅ | ❌ | Medium |
| **Trendline** | **✅ Full** | **✅ 4 sports** | **✅ Point-in-time** | **High** |

**Trendline's moat**: No competitor offers the combination of ensemble modeling across 4 sports with full methodological transparency AND point-in-time backtesting. This is the quantitative finance approach applied to sports — and it's defensible.

## IV. WHAT INVESTORS CARE ABOUT

### A. Tier 1 Metrics (Must-Haves Before Raising)

| Metric | Target for Seed | Target for Series A |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Monthly Active Users (MAU)** | 5,000+ | 50,000+ |
| **Paid subscribers** | 500+ | 5,000+ |
| **MRR** | $10K+ | $100K+ |
| **Free → Paid conversion** | 5-10% | 8-15% |
| **Monthly churn** | <8% | <5% |
| **Pick accuracy (documented)** | 55%+ ATS or +EV verified | 55%+ with 1,000+ pick sample |
| **Unit ROI (backtested)** | +3-8% ROI | +3-8% verified live |

### B. Tier 2 Metrics (Differentiators)

- **Data pipeline coverage**: Number of games/sports/leagues modeled
- **Model freshness**: How quickly models update with new data
- **Backtesting depth**: Years of historical coverage, sample sizes
- **User engagement**: Sessions per week, picks viewed per session
- **Community/virality**: Referral rate, social sharing of picks

### C. What Makes Investors Say Yes

1. **Verifiable track record** — Not "trust me," but auditable, timestamped picks with transparent methodology
2. **Retention signal** — Users who stay through losing streaks prove product-market fit
3. **Revenue per user headroom** — Serious bettors spend $50-200/mo on tools; LTV can be very high
4. **Regulatory safety** — "We don't take bets, we sell analytics" is a clean regulatory story
5. **Multiple revenue streams** — B2C subscriptions + B2B data licensing + affiliate/referral revenue
6. **Team** — Quantitative background + sports domain expertise + product/eng capability

---

## V. INVESTOR POSITIONING STRATEGY

### A. Narrative Framework

**Primary narrative**: *"Trendline is the quantitative analytics infrastructure for the $35B+ US sports betting market. We're not a sportsbook — we're the Bloomberg terminal for sports bettors, built on proprietary ensemble models with full transparency and verified backtesting."*

**Supporting pillars**:

1. **Massive, growing TAM** — 38+ legal states, $120B+ annual handle, 85%+ mobile
2. **Underserved sophisticated segment** — Sharp/aspiring-sharp bettors have no institutional-grade tooling
3. **Proprietary tech moat** — Ensemble models, 150K+ game Elo database, point-in-time backtesting, 1,500+ team alias resolver
4. **Clean regulatory position** — Analytics/information product, not a gambling operator
5. **Multiple monetization paths** — B2C subs, B2B licensing, media partnerships, affiliate revenue

### B. Positioning Against Comps

| If they ask... | You say... |
|---------------|-----------|
| "How are you different from Action Network?" | "Action Network is media. We're models. They aggregate opinions; we run quantitative pipelines across 4 sports with backtested accuracy." |
| "What about OddsJam?" | "OddsJam finds arbitrage in posted lines. We generate independent fair-value estimates. They need sportsbook mistakes; we find structural edges." |
| "Isn't this just a tout service?" | "Tout services are black boxes selling personality. We publish our methodology, backtest without lookahead bias, and let users audit every signal." |
| "Can't sportsbooks just build this?" | "Sportsbooks have it internally. The opportunity is giving *bettors* the same tools — like how Bloomberg serves traders, not banks." |

### C. Strategic Acquirers (Long-term Exit Targets)

| Company | Why They'd Acquire |
|---------|--------------------|
| **Better Collective** | Already bought Action Network; adding quantitative layer |
| **Flutter/FanDuel** | In-app analytics differentiation |
| **DraftKings** | Content + analytics moat |
| **ESPN/Disney** | Analytics content for ESPN Bet integration |
| **Penn/ESPN Bet** | Differentiated bettor tools |
| **Sportradar** | Expand from B2B → B2C analytics |
| **Yahoo Sports** | Re-enter sports betting with analytics angle |

---

## IX. RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Sportsbooks build similar tools in-house | They're incentivized to keep bettors uninformed; our audience is the bettor, not the house |
| Regulatory changes restrict analytics tools | Analytics/information is protected speech; we don't facilitate wagers |
| Model accuracy degrades | Ensemble approach + continuous retraining + transparent methodology builds trust even through drawdowns |
| High churn (sports are seasonal) | Multi-sport coverage, off-season content (draft models, futures analysis), annual pricing incentives |
| Market saturation of pick services | Differentiate on transparency and quantitative rigor; tout fatigue actually helps us |

---

## X. KEY TALKING POINTS FOR INVESTOR CONVERSATIONS

1. **"38 states, $120B+ in annual handle, and bettors have worse tools than a 2005 stock trader."** The analytics gap in sports betting is where financial markets were 30 years ago.

2. **"We backtest without cheating."** Point-in-time backtesting means our historical accuracy numbers are real. Most competitors can't say that because they don't control for lookahead bias.

3. **"Our data moat compounds daily."** Every game adds to our 150K+ game database. Elo ratings improve with more data. Our ensemble models get better over time — this is a flywheel.

4. **"We're regulation-proof."** Information products sit cleanly outside gambling regulation. We're closer to a financial data terminal than a sportsbook.

5. **"The Action Network playbook, but quantitative."** Better Collective paid ~$240M for a content/community platform. A model-driven platform with proprietary data and verified accuracy is worth more.

6. **"Multi-sport from day one."** Most analytics tools are single-sport. Our architecture — Elo ratings, ensemble modeling, unified team resolver — scales across any sport with structured data.

---

## XI. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Launch a public track record page** — Timestamped picks, updated daily, fully auditable. This is the single most important credibility signal.

2. **Build a waitlist / free tier** — Start acquiring users now. Even 1,000 email signups validates interest.

3. **Document everything** — Model methodology, backtest results, data pipeline architecture. Investors in this space are increasingly technical.

4. **Start producing content** — Weekly model insights, accuracy reports, "how we think about X" posts. Builds SEO + credibility + audience simultaneously.

5. **Set up affiliate tracking** — Even before paid subs, affiliate revenue from sportsbook signups can fund early operations and prove commercial intent.

6. **Assemble an advisory board** — 2-3 advisors from: sports betting industry, quantitative finance, and consumer SaaS. Signals seriousness to investors.
